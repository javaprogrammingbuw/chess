# Todo:
* Implement a game of chess including the following properties:
  * Moving pieces just if it is a valid move (note: each chess piece has a different move set)
  * Checking for end of the game (check, checkmate, ...)
* Both players play in the same window. Just make sure that after every move the turn of the other player starts
